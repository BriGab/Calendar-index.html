# Work Day Scheduler<h1>

This application was created for the purpose of allowing users to enter events, appointments,etc. into each hour of their work day and be able to save for future reference. This is important for time management and organization. Special features of this app include:

- Ability to save each hour's event individually and have those events persist upon refreshing the page.
- Keeping track of current time easily by each hour block being color coded, the current hour highlighted in red.
- Option to go back and change events by editing or adding something new. 

Moment.js was used for keeping track of time in this app. I found the documentation a little confusing at first but quickly realized how endless possibilities were using Moment.js. 

Each hour in this app is hard coded while the features present themselves via javascript, moment.js, and local storage. In the future I'd like to re-visit this app and create each block of time dynamically instead of hard coding them.
